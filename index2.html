  so I told Michael, our Puglab PR spokesperson, that I can't keep going back to
  the well because the joke of hearing one accent 30 times only stretches so far. He didn't love it, he had a
  hard time with it, despite Usain Bolt's recent success. "We had a good thing
  going" he said, "this doesn't have to end, it's still funny." No, Michael,
  it's getting old. It's time to explore other people with foreign
  accents willing to do voice work for, like, $5..<br><br>
  Pretty much I fired the guy on your birthday.<br><br>
  It wasn't a good breakup, he took it very hard. I told him that he could do
  one last video honoring you and your birthday some 40 or whatever years ago.
  He agreed, but he really took it in a weird direction. Sorry, this probably
  isn't what you had in mind. He and I are friends so I really had to pawn off
  the firing on you.<br><br>
  You wouldn't believe how hard it is to get a video of The Verve Pipe that
  Youtube will let you embed. This isn't exactly Beyonce. I don't think The Verve Pipe
  is really stressing on free Youtube views. Anyways, can't wait to see them
  tour with Smashmouth later this year. </div>
